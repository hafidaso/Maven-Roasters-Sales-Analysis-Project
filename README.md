# Maven Roasters Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aimed to analyze the sales data of Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop with three locations in New York City. Our goal was to uncover sales trends, identify the busiest days, and determine which products drive the most revenue for the business.

## Data Description
The dataset includes transaction records featuring details such as the transaction date, time, location, and product-level details such as quantity, unit price, category, and type.

## Methodology
The analysis followed a structured approach, including:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensured data quality and consistency.
- Time Series Analysis: Identified sales trends over time and assessed seasonality effects.
- Product Analysis: Evaluated product performance by sales volume and revenue contribution.
- Store Performance: Analyzed sales distribution across different store locations.

## Key Insights
- A significant upward trend in sales volume over the first half of 2023 was observed.
- Coffee and tea were the top revenue-generating products.
- Sales and revenue were fairly evenly distributed across the three store locations.
- Weekday sales showed Friday as the busiest day, suggesting potential for targeted promotional efforts.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The analysis provided Maven Roasters with valuable insights into their sales patterns. We recommended leveraging the popularity of coffee and tea to promote other items and employing targeted marketing strategies to enhance sales on slower days and at underperforming locations. 

## Tools Used
- Python for data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas for data aggregation and time series analysis.
- Matplotlib for creating visualizations.
